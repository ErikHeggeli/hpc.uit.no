In the April 2024 newsletter we would like to focus on some support and training events coming up:


**HPC office hours**

Every Wednesday, 10:30-12:00, the HPC group staff is available for users to chat either in person in Modulbygget, Room A209 and A210 <https://link.mazemap.com/yfStfXRc>
or on Teams. For more info, please see <https://hpc.uit.no/contact/> and keep an eye on <https://uit.no/tavla> where we post about the events.

On April 10 (HPC onboarding course), May 1 (International Labour day) and May 22 (staff away due to NRIS meeting) we will pause the HPC office hours.

**NRIS training events spring of 2024**

- The popular NRIS beginners course – HPC onboarding – is being arranged just after Easter, April 9-11, 2024:
<https://documentation.sigma2.no/training/events/2024-04-hpc-on-boarding.html>. This course is still now open for registration: <https://skjemaker.app.uib.no/view.php?id=16342012>, but please be quick about it!

- Day 3 of the "Best Practices on Clusters Spring Series 2024" <https://documentation.sigma2.no/training/events/2024-spring-best-practices-series.html> will be dedicated to file transfer and data storage.
