In the March 2024 newsletter we would like to focus on some support and training events coming up:


**HPC office hours**

Every Wednesday, 10:30-12:00, the HPC group staff is available for users to chat either in person in Modulbygget, Room A209 and A210 <https://link.mazemap.com/yfStfXRc>
or on Teams. For more info, please see <https://hpc.uit.no/contact/> and keep an eye on <https://uit.no/tavla> where we post about the events.

On March 27 (Wednesday before Easter) and April 10 (HPC onboarding course) we will pause the HPC office hours.


**Best Practices on Clusters Spring Series 2024 has started**

NRIS is offering a best practices course for users of national infrastructure services.
The workshop is organised as a series of monthly events. The series starts on 8th February and ends on 23 May.
During these monthly training events, each topic will focus on different aspects related to the everyday usage of HPC/storage facilities:
